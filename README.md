# BlindAid - Assistive Technology System

A consolidated multi-modal assistive technology system designed to help visually impaired individuals navigate their environment through object detection, text reading (OCR), and face recognition.

## Features

### 🕹️ Integrated Controller (New)

- Single window experience with hotkeys for scene understanding, reading, captions, and depth cues
- Scene mode merges YOLO object detection with known-face recognition and speech cooldowns
- On-demand BLIP captioning (`C`) for rich descriptions
- MiDaS depth summaries (`D`) to approximate how far objects are

### 🎯 Object Detection Mode

- Real-time detection of objects using YOLO
- Position identification (left/center/right)
- Audio announcements of detected objects and their locations
- Customizable confidence thresholds

### 📖 OCR Mode

- Real-time text recognition using PaddleOCR
- Text-to-speech for reading detected text
- High-confidence filtering for accurate readings
- Visual bounding boxes around detected text

### 👤 Face Recognition Mode

- Real-time face detection and recognition
- Position detection (left/middle/right)
- Audio announcements with person identification
- Support for custom face databases
- Optimized performance with YOLO-based face detection

## Quick Start

### Installation

1. **Create a virtual environment & install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   # Windows
   .venv\\Scripts\\activate
   # Linux / macOS
   source .venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   
   The requirements file now installs the editable `blindaid` package with every runtime extra.
   See `docs/INSTALL.md` for uv/pipx alternatives and developer tooling instructions.

2. **Set up resources:**
   - Copy YOLO object detection model to: `resources/models/object_blind_aide.pt`
   - Copy YOLO face detection model to: `resources/models/yolov9t-face-lindevs.pt`
   - Copy known faces to: `resources/known_faces/<person_name>/*.jpg`

### Running the System

#### Integrated Controller (Recommended)

```bash
python -m blindaid
```

##### Hotkeys

- `1`: Scene understanding (objects + faces)
- `2`: Reading mode (OCR)
- `C`: Generate a descriptive caption for the current frame *(requires optional advanced extras)*
- `D`: Run depth analysis on the latest scene detections *(requires optional advanced extras)*
- `Q`: Quit the application

#### Object Detection Mode

```bash
python -m blindaid --mode object-detection
```

##### Controls (Object Detection)

- Press `q` to quit
- Press `s` to manually trigger audio announcement

#### OCR Mode

```bash
python -m blindaid --mode ocr
```

##### Controls (OCR)

- Press `q` to quit
- Press `s` to speak detected text
- Show text to camera for automatic reading

#### Face Recognition Mode

```bash
python -m blindaid --mode face
```

##### Controls (Face)

- Press `q` to quit
- Automatic announcements when faces are recognized

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Camera

```bash
python -m blindaid --mode object-detection --camera 1
```

### Adjust Confidence Threshold

```bash
python -m blindaid --mode object-detection --confidence 0.7
```

### Disable Audio

```bash
python -m blindaid --mode ocr --no-audio
```

### Custom Known Faces Directory

```bash
python -m blindaid --mode face --known-faces ./my_faces
```

### Debug Mode

```bash
python -m blindaid --mode face --debug
```

## Demo Instructions for Professor

### Preparation

1. Ensure camera is connected and working
2. Install all dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Copy models to `resources/models/` directory
4. Add at least 2-3 known faces to `resources/known_faces/`

### Demonstration Sequence

#### 1. Object Detection Demo (2-3 minutes)

```bash
python -m blindaid --mode object-detection
```

- Show common objects (pen, book, bag, bottle)
- Move objects to different positions (left/center/right)
- Demonstrate audio announcements
- Press 's' to manually trigger announcements

#### 2. OCR Demo (2-3 minutes)

```bash
python -m blindaid --mode ocr
```

- Show printed text (book cover, document, sign)
- Demonstrate automatic text reading
- Show confidence-based filtering with low-quality text
- Press 's' for manual reading

#### 3. Face Recognition Demo (2-3 minutes)

```bash
python -m blindaid --mode face
```

- Show registered faces and their recognition
- Demonstrate position detection (left/middle/right)
- Show "Unknown" detection for unregistered faces
- Audio announcements with names and positions

#### 4. Integrated Scene Demo (Optional bonus)

```bash
python -m blindaid
```

- Toggle between scene (`1`) and reading (`2`) modes in real time
- Trigger caption (`C`) for descriptions and depth (`D`) for distance hints
- Highlight combined speech feedback for people and objects

### Tips for Successful Demo

- Good lighting is essential
- Keep objects/text/faces at reasonable distance (1-3 feet)
- Ensure camera is stable
- Test each mode before the demo
- Have backup objects/text samples ready

## Troubleshooting

### Camera not opening

- Check camera index with `--camera 0` or `--camera 1`
- Ensure no other application is using the camera

### Models not found

- Verify model paths in `resources/models/`
- Check file names match configuration in `core/config.py`

### Audio not working

- Check system audio settings
- Try `--no-audio` flag to run without audio
- For OCR, ensure internet connection (uses gTTS)

### Poor detection accuracy

- Improve lighting conditions
- Adjust `--confidence` threshold
- Move closer to camera
- Ensure camera is focused

## Configuration

All default configurations are in `blindaid/core/config.py`. You can modify:

- Model paths
- Confidence thresholds
- Camera settings
- Audio settings
- Performance parameters
